### Update dashboards remotely

This version introduces a new function for updating dashboards remotely. You can now use Update-UDDashboard to send new dashboard content to a remote dashboard. When starting a dashboard, you can now specify an UpdateToken to serve as a password for updating content. 

This means that you can deploy a simple script that just starts a dashboard server on a remote machine without having to deploy the entire dashboard script contents. You can then update it remotely at any time. 

```
Start-UDDashboard -Port 10000 -UpdateToken 1234
Update-UDDashboard -Url http://localhost:10000 -UpdateToken 1234 -Content {
     New-UDDashboard -Title "Updated" -Content {
        New-UDCard -Title "Update"
     }
}
```

### Collapsibles

Material Design collapsibles are accordion elements that expand when clicked on. They allow you to hide content that is not immediately relevant to the user. It will allow you to group charts, grids and other components into sections that users can expand and collapse. 

```
New-UDCollapsible -Id "Collapsible" -Items {
   New-UDCollapsibleItem -Title "First" -Icon user -Content {
      New-UDCard -Title "First"
   } -Active
   New-UDCollapsibleItem -Title "Second" -Icon group -Content {
      New-UDCard -Title "Second"
   }
   New-UDCollapsibleItem -Title "Third" -Icon user -Content {
      New-UDCard -Title "Third"
   }
}
```
